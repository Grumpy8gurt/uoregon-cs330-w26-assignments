Homework 1
1) Implement the function 'find_file()' which recursively searches the provided directory and its subdirectories to locate any file that matches the provided file name.

    Make sure to read the provided code FIRST before beginning the assignment.
 

2) Test your code against the provided directory structure and answer files. Use the following command to compile the code:

     gcc -std=c11 -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE main.c

    For example, executing './a.out . b.out' should generate the same output as what is shown in the 'ans1' file (it may be in a slightly different order).

    Executing './a.out . a.out' should generate the same output as what is shown in the 'ans2' file (it may be in a slightly different order).

    Play around with different directory structures and file names to make sure your code works correctly - your assignment will be evaluated on a different input directory structure and file names.


3) Commit your code and push it to GitHub.
 

4) Make sure the change has been successfully pushed to GitHub by going to your repo on the GitHub Classroom website and reading your main.c file
